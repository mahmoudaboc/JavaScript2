Make a HTML todo list. 

```
const myList = 'Make homework. Brush teeth. Buy a pony. Call my mother. Make a todo list.'
```

Result should look like this in HTML:

• Make homework. 
• Brush teeth. 
• Buy a pony. 
• Call my mother. 
• Make a todo list.

Rules:
1) You may NOT split the string manually (you must use a javascript operator to do this).
2) You may NOT write any text directly into the HTML
